Coursework for IN4150 Distributed algorithms course at TU Delft, implementing various distributed algorithms with Java RMI.

Project 1: Point-to-point message exchange with Schiper-Eggli-Sandoz protocol for causal ordering.
Project 2: Suzuki-Kasami mutual exclusion algorithm.

Both projects contain server and client parts, with server instances able to run within several different physical machines. The configuration of network is maintained in a .cfg file. Client is emulated with JUnit tests. More detailed information can be found in README files in project roots.
