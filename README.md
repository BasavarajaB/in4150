Coursework for IN4150 Distributed algorithms course at TU Delft. Contains implementations of three various distributed algorithms built using Java RMI.

* Project 1: Point-to-point message exchange with Schiper-Eggli-Sandoz protocol for causal ordering.

* Project 2: Suzuki-Kasami mutual exclusion algorithm.

* Project 3: An algorithm describing Byzantine generals' problem.

All three projects contain server and client parts, with server instances able to run simultaneously on several different computers. The configuration of network is maintained in a .cfg file. Client is emulated with JUnit tests. More detailed information can be found in `README.md` files in project roots.
